-Four inputs for now:
-
-procedure sequence for now is p1, p2, p3, p4
-
-All in .xls format
-==========================
-
-1) workface-distance:
-This file contains a NxN matrix holding distances between all workfaces.
-Each cell contains the exact distance in meters between two workfaces.
-e.g. 
-   w1  w2  w3                                   A1  B1  C1
-w1 ..  ..  ..                                1  ..  ..  ..
-w2 ..  ..  ..                                2  ..  ..  ..
-w3 ..  ..  ..   distance matrix is stored in 3  ..  ..  ..
-(.. means distance value)
-
-
-2) workface-state:
-This file indicates whether each workface is available or not.
-Each cell only has two possible values (1 available, 0 not available).
-Column A1, B1, C1... indicates workface 1, workface 2, workface 3...
-
-3)machine-op-info:
-both units for Operating Rate (OR) and Moving Rate (MR) are in meter/min
-OR  MR

-
-
-4)workface-workload:
-workload is measured by meter/min
